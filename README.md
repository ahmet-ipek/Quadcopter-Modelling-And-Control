# Quadcopter-Modelling-And-Control

1. **Introduction**

A quadcopter is a multirotor aerial vehicle with four rotors, allowing it to hover, maneuver in 3D space, and maintain stability through precise control of thrust and torques. To simulate and control a quadcopter, understanding its dynamics is crucial. The equations governing the motion of the quadcopter are derived from fundamental principles, including Newton-Euler equations for rigid body dynamics.

The purpose of this section is to explain how the translational and rotational dynamics of the quadcopter are derived, with an emphasis on:

- Forces and moments acting on the quadcopter.
- Translational dynamics that govern the movement in 3D space.
- Rotational dynamics that control orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw).

These equations form the basis of the quadcopterâ€™s simulation and control system, implemented in MATLAB and Simulink. They allow us to model the quadcopter's response to motor inputs, environmental forces, and trajectory-following commands.

2. Coordinate Frames

To describe the motion of the quadcopter, two coordinate frames are used:

2.1. Inertial Frame

The inertial frame is a fixed reference frame used to define the global position and orientation of the quadcopter. It is often represented as an Earth-centered frame:

Axes:
- X: Points North.
- Y: Points East.
- Z: Points Downward.

2.2. Body Frame

The body frame is a moving frame attached to the quadcopter's center of gravity (CoG). It rotates with the quadcopter:

Axes:
- x: Points forward.
- y: Points to the right.
- z: Points downward.
